Hello everyone, i made this code while i was in a interview on hackerearth.

The quest is to create an function that receives a duration in seconds(number) and returns a string with "horas, minutos e segundos", for example:

3651 seconds ->    1 hora, 50 minutos e 1 segundo 
122 seconds ->   2 minutos e 2 segundos

I hope everyone has good studies!
